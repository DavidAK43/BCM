Battlefield conquest mode for Arma3 - PvPvE - 3 sided scenario containing ( NATO, CSAT, AAF )

=======================
DESCRIPTION:
=======================
- Battlefield Conquest Mode aka BCM is a game mode derived from BF conquest game mode. I always wanted to bring the same style to the Arma engine. With more vehicles, realistic ballistics, bigger atmosphere, limitless scenarios, side objectives, grouping and even logistics of sorts.
